  # define the db service

    # specify the image to use for the db service from docker hub. If we have a custom image, we can specify that in this format
    # In the above two services, we're using the build context to build the image for the service from the Dockerfile so we specify the image as "build: ./frontend" or "build: ./backend".
    # but for the db service, we're using the image from docker hub so we specify the image as "image: mongo:latest"
    # you can find the image name and tag for mongodb from docker hub here: https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo
    image: mongo:latest

    # specify the ports to expose for the db service
    # generally, we do this in api service using mongodb atlas. But for demo purposes, we're using a local mongodb instance
    # usually, mongodb runs on port 27017. So we're exposing the port 27017 on the host machine and mapping it to the port 27017 inside the container

    # specify the volumes to mount for the db service

# The commented out section below is an example of how to define a PostgreSQL
# database that your application can use. `depends_on` tells Docker Compose to
# start the database before your application. The `db-data` volume persists the
# database data between container restarts. The `db-password` secret is used
# to set the database password. You must create `db/password.txt` and add
# a password of your choosing to it before running `docker-compose up`.
